<h1 id="please-dont-just-say-hello-in-chat">Please Say Hello In Chat</h1>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Although modern chat communication should be done in a way that saves time for all participants and enables an efficient, asynchronous exchange of information, please be mindful that you are part of a civilized society. <strong>Don’t expect an answer if you just write “Hello” in chat</strong>. Instead, phrase a message that inquires about your chat partner's well-being before asking your question; this allows them to see that you are acting in an inclusive manner before jumping into what <strong>you</strong> want. Doing so not only will allow them to provide a meaningful response as soon as they allocate time to read and answer your message, but will exercise the few moments it takes to apply common courtesy to human interaction.</p>
<h2 id="chat-etiquette">Chat Etiquette</h2>
<pre>
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
# CO-WORKER WONDERS WHY YOU ONLY REACH OUT TO ASK FOR HELP, FEELING USED
2010-07-19 12:33:32 co-worker: [answers question]
</pre>
<p>It’s as if you called someone on the phone only when you needed something!</p>
<p>Please do this instead:</p>
<pre>
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi, how are you today?
2010-07-19 12:32:15 co-worker: Hello, I'm doing great thanks. How about you?
# CO-WORKER IS SURPRISED YOU ASKED, AND DISPLAYS MUTUAL RESPECT
2010-07-19 12:34:01 you: Doing pretty good, thanks for asking! I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
2010-07-19 12:35:21 co-worker: Oh, that's [answer...]
</pre>
<p>Note that it only takes a few moments to ask about someone's current state; in these unprecedented times, a few moments to ask such a simple question can make a big difference in someone's day. The co-worker can start thinking about your question right away while feeling good that you actually care about how they are feeling!</p>
<p>You’re trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like you would do in person or on the phone. Although Chat is neither of those things, you shouldn't sacrifice the time it takes to seize an opportunity to brighten someone's day. Instead of being rude, considering this as lost productivity, view it as building a stronger relationship.</p>
<p>The same goes for, “I need help. [request]”, “Hi Bob – quick question: [question].”, and “This isn't working--[explains]”. Just ask how their doing!</p>
<p>If you feel you can't spend 30 seconds to ask how someone is doing, you can do something like this:</p>
<pre>
2010-07-19 12:32:12 you: Hi -- I hope you are doing well! If you're not busy I was wondering if I could ask a question. I'm working on [something] and I'm trying to do [etc...]
</pre>
<p>Additionally, if you view being polite as "lost productivity", perhaps you should consider being more empathetic, or seeking out a profession that requires less human interaction.</p>
<h2 id="call-etiquette">Call Etiquette</h2>
<p>If you haven't talked to someone in a while, consider taking the time for a call with them to really check in. With remote work increasing, a human voice can be a refreshing interaction that many are seeking.</p>
<p>Instead of simply sending a message, or asking “hey, how are you?” (which is better but not great), you can try something like this:</p>
<pre>
2020-07-08 12:32:12 you: Hi - I know we haven't talked in a while, and that we're both busy, but I'd really love to touch base with you sometime. How does [date] sound? [etc...]
</pre>
<p>This does three things: it shows the individual you care, it gives the recipient the freedom to schedule the call on their time, and it helps them to see that you value them more than just a source of information. Be the change you want to see in the world. Take a few moments today to exercise this simple practice of quality human interaction.</p>
